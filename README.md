Get a dev environment set up! Yes, you! 

* Symlink themes to wp-content/themes
* Do the same for plugins.
* In your hosts file, point www.scsun-news.com to localhost.
* Use the apache virtual host file in the dev folder (may need to adjust wordpress directory paths) to point your webserver to that domain.
* I'll have an wordpress export XML document for you soon.
