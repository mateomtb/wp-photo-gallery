The region also bought a hazmat trailer with tents, hoses, towels and clothing. Regional coordinator Susie Wickman said officials are concerned about chemical spills along the rail route that runs through Lamar. &#8220;It’s a hard thing to measure preparedness,” she said. “It’s only when you don’t have it and you weren’t prepared that you find out.&#8221;" },

The hazmat identification kit purchase was approved because of a &#8220;white-powder&#8221; incident in 2008 that shut down the local hospital for three hours. It turned out the powder that slipped out of envelopes in the mailroom was part of a marketing ploy from a company that makes fake snow, but authorities didn’t figure that out until they had run about 50 people through a decontamination shower." },
