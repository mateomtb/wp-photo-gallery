dfm-wp-data
===========

Wordpress configuration plugin to feed site specific variables

######How to use

Activate the plugin

Use these static functions to retrieve data (see class interface for DFMDataForWP)

	public static function retrieveValueFromMasterData($select, $where, $whereValue);
	// DFMDataForWP::retrieveValueFromMasterData('zip_code', 'domain', 'denverpost'));
	// returns "80203" 

	public static function retrieveRowFromMasterData($where, $whereValue);
	// DFMDataForWP::retrieveRowFromMasterData('domain', 'denverpost'));
	// returns an associative array of all data for the Denver Post

######Notes

Pull from Github to retrieve most up-to-date data and then either reactivate the plugin, or click the "Update DB" button under Settings >> DFM WP Data Manager in the WordPress dashboard.

######TODO

Currently the data comes from a text file generated by an external script and any resulting changes need to be tested before use in production

The external script pulls from a Google Drive document

Because of the above:

Would like to develop a frontend (possibly outside of WordPress) that would handle the data entry and middleman step

Possibly move the entire plugin and resulting DB outside of WordPress and onto its own server for use in any setting
